* Chapter 3: Do things a Clojure Crash Course
** Syntax 

   Clojure code is written in a uniform structure:
   
   1) Literal representations of data structures
   2) Operations 

   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
   1
   "a string" 
   ["a" "vector" "of" "strings"]
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:

   Operations are how you do things, '+' is an example of an operation:

   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
   (+ 1 2 3)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : 6
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
     (str "It was the panda " "in the library " "with a dust buster")
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : It was the panda in the library with a dust buster
   
** Control flow

   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
     ()
   #+END_SRC
